# MyReads: A Book Tracking App Project

## About

This is part of Udacity React Nanodegree project in which I have created a bookshelf app that allows user to select and manage their own book reading journey such us managing the status of their book in shelfs (currently reading, want to read, and read). The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

## Installation

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* run http://localhost:3000/ to open the app
